# react-2023

A template for my React projects in 2023.

As of 2023, I like to start with

- typescript
- react
- parcel
- prettier

And yarn for package management.

## IDE support

If you're using a VSCode-based editor, eg Cursor, install the
[esbenp.prettier-vscode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
extension to have `prettier` run on save.
